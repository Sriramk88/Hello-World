# Hello-World
As usual starting with Hello World!! :)

Not sure why I am doing this!!
Seems pretty straight forward but then I am inside a lab on a beautiful sunny day...
with nothing better to do than type this... Its kinda poetic how I am poring my heart out into a version control software...
actually I meant ironic since I hate version control softwares....
so long... and break a leg!!
